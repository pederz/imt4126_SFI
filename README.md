## StyleGAN2 Encoder (Google Colab)
Ensure that the current paths exist in google drive or rewrite the paths in the script:  
"/Biometrics/samples/aligned_images/" - For the aligned facial biometric samples.  
"/Biometrics/samples/generated_images/" - For the generated biometric samples and the latent space vectors.  
"/Biometrics/stylegan2encoder".  

1. Upload the StyleGAN2encoder.ipynb to Google Colab.
2. In notebook settings:
  * Select "GPU" in Hardware accelerator
  * Select "Standard" in Runtime shape
3. Run the cells.
